=== To:  Dr. Hapke/R.N Miluska - thank you.

Today = 2 NOV 2025 ( 6 pm) \
Kaiser #53662095 \
Colonoscopy #1 - Nov 5, 2025 \

Per conversation with Miluska, upped Miralax to 4 DOSES (4 x 17g) each day; mineral enema to begin asap.


#show heading: set text(navy)

== Note:  Stool Change

#show heading: set text(black)

~4:30 pm - Stool #1, soft but elongated, a little swollen; definite improvement! \
~5:30 pm - Stool #2, mud ball, some sticks to toilet, sticks to me, not watery, not normal, just mud \
~7:30 pm - Stool #3, semi-explosive, only 2 chunks, some gas, some structure, very soft, hard to clean myself; (need to change clothes, shower) \


=== Thurs 30 Oct 2025 miralax = 3 doses 

11 am - Stool #1, more mud balls, sticks to toilet, sticks to floor, sticks to clothes; mess. (need to change clothes, shower) \
4  pm - Stool #2, very soft, light brown, a little more structure than just `mud`; sticks;   lots tissues to clean; \
afterwards, fair amount of gas, movement in abdomen \
?? pm - Stool #3, not too much, soft, sticks to toilet,  intermittent gas continues. \



=== Fri 31 Oct 2025 = 3 doses miralax (3 x 17 g = 51 g)
9:30 am - Stool #1, very soft, not very much; sticks,  gas continues.   Note:  still far from texture/appearance for colonoscopy \
late am - Stool #2, 2 chunks, not much but otherwise same: gas, sticks, lots of dirty tissues \
8 pm    - Stool #3, small amt, otherwise same \
8:15 pm - Stool #4, bit more, otherwise same:  gas, sticky, dirty tissues.. \
10:15 pm- Stool #5  more \

Note:  texture, color, density FAR from ready for colonoscopy procedure:  for one, stool is opaque; dense, not mostly water


=== Sat 1 Nov 2025
NO miralax today \
11:30 am mineral oil enema (before food) - anything happen?  did it go in?? \
1 pm - Kaiser - ask to speak to doctor   (per directions, no bowl movement in 15' contact doctor) \
2 pm - Stool #1 - looks same as Miralax and same mess.
4 pm - Kaiser doctor says 2 hours within normal range (why not told these things?) \
9:30 pm - Stool #2 - very similar to Miralax

Diet continues:  plain yogurt, smooth peanut butter, honey, cheese, coffee, and too much ice cream; veggie broth (had nothing healthy in days)

=== Sun 2 Nov 2025
No Jardiance \
No Miralax \
7:30 am - mineral oil enema (#2) \
Same as 1st one:  did it go in?  is working?    (~ 15' or more, on back, butt up, feet in air, but nothing) \

8:30 am - Stool #1  explosive discharge, but little actual output, oil and a few specs of feces \
10' later, 2nd discharge, very similar \
stomach movemnt/gas/noise; no pain; but something moving \

10 am - Stool #2  Like Miralax, mud, not like today's earlier stool;  not very much, but sticks, opaque..\
1 pm - Stool #3  Similar to Stool #2, bit more quantity.\

Diet remains fat + sugar.\
Getting weaker. \
